For a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of a distributed key-value store, you'll need to focus on implementing the essential features that demonstrate the core functionality and value of the system. Hereâ€™s a list of the bare minimum features to include:

- Starts from call from main class where concurrent hash map created.
- Each instance of application will have single hash map.
- Separate class for each operation to make it extensible on the long run and make it generic compitable.


### **1. Basic Key-Value Operations**

- **Set (PUT):** Ability to store key-value pairs.
- **Get:** Ability to retrieve values by key.
- **Delete:** Ability to remove key-value pairs.

**Example Code:**

```java
public class SimpleKVStore {
    private final Map<String, String> store = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

    public void put(String key, String value) {
        store.put(key, value);
    }

    public String get(String key) {
        return store.get(key);
    }

    public void delete(String key) {
        store.remove(key);
    }
}
```

### **2. Data Partitioning (Sharding)**

- **Partitioning:** Distribute data across multiple nodes to handle larger datasets and load.
- **Hashing:** Use consistent hashing or another partitioning scheme to determine the node responsible for storing a particular key.

**Example Approach:**

- Implement a simple hash function to determine which node (or shard) should handle a given key.

### **3. Basic Replication**

- **Replication:** Ensure that data is duplicated across multiple nodes to provide redundancy and fault tolerance.
- **Synchronization:** Implement basic mechanisms to synchronize data across replicas.

**Example Approach:**

- Use a primary-replica model where writes are performed on the primary node and then replicated to replicas.

### **4. Fault Tolerance**

- **Node Failure Handling:** Detect and handle node failures to maintain system availability.
- **Data Recovery:** Implement mechanisms to recover data from replicas in case of a node failure.

**Example Approach:**

- Use heartbeat signals or a monitoring system to detect node failures and reassign responsibilities as needed.

### **5. Basic Consistency Model**

- **Consistency:** Decide on a simple consistency model for your MVP. This could be strong consistency (quorum-based reads/writes) or eventual consistency.

**Example Approach:**

- Implement a quorum-based approach where a majority of nodes must agree on read and write operations to ensure consistency.

### **6. Basic Networking and Communication**

- **Node Communication:** Implement basic networking to allow nodes to communicate with each other for data replication and synchronization.
- **Protocol:** Use a simple protocol for node communication, such as HTTP or TCP, depending on your system's requirements.

**Example Approach:**

- Use a REST API or a custom TCP protocol for communication between nodes.

### **7. Basic Error Handling and Logging**

- **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling to manage issues such as network failures, data corruption, or invalid operations.
- **Logging:** Add logging to track key operations and errors for debugging and monitoring.

**Example Code:**

```java
public class SimpleKVStore {
    // Existing methods...

    public void put(String key, String value) {
        try {
            store.put(key, value);
            // Log operation
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Handle and log error
        }
    }

    public String get(String key) {
        try {
            return store.get(key);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Handle and log error
            return null;
        }
    }
}
```

### **8. Basic Management and Monitoring**

- **Health Checks:** Implement basic health checks to ensure nodes are functioning correctly.
- **Metrics:** Collect and expose basic metrics for monitoring system performance and health.

**Example Approach:**

- Provide endpoints or methods to check node status and basic metrics like uptime and request counts.

### **Summary**

For your MVP, focus on the following core aspects:

1. **Key-Value Operations:** Implement basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
2. **Partitioning and Replication:** Distribute data across nodes and replicate it for fault tolerance.
3. **Fault Tolerance:** Handle node failures and data recovery.
4. **Consistency:** Choose and implement a basic consistency model.
5. **Networking:** Enable communication between nodes.
6. **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement basic error handling and logging mechanisms.
7. **Management and Monitoring:** Provide basic health checks and monitoring capabilities.

These features will allow you to build a functional distributed key-value store that demonstrates the core principles and value of the system. Once the MVP is working, you can iterate and add more advanced features as needed.
